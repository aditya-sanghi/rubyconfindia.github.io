			<p>Are you using interfaces effectively? Interfaces are one of the most powerful language features that Go provides, yet Go programmers often under-utilize existing interfaces in their code. Even many advanced Gophers rarely write their own interfaces, or write interfaces that are less powerful than they could be.<br /><br />This talk provides a behind-the-scenes look at the two most ubiquitous interfaces of them all: the humble "io.Reader" and "error". These interfaces are simple in nature, yet hold the key to writing powerful code. In this talk, we will learn how to design our own interfaces in Go that are simple yet powerful – just like "io.Reader" and "error". We will learn how to correctly identify the places where writing interfaces will improve our code, and the specific steps to ensuring that our interfaces - and therefore our programs - are as powerful as they can be.</p>

			<p>80% of software development can be taken up by maintenance and this is where all your sins during early development will come back to bite you. Interfaces make change easier and can help to fight the maintenance burden.<br /><br />But if you want to learn how to use interfaces effectively in Go, you’re in for a lot of disappointment. The existing resources tell you a lot about what an interface is and how to use one, but they fall short in explaining the more important Why and When to use one.<br /><br />To learn this, you would need to spend hours digging through OOP design pattern books and reading hundreds of lines of Java, C++ or Objective-C code.<br /><br />It’s your lucky day! I have already done this for you.<br /><br />Come to this talk to gain a better understanding of when it make sense to grab in your toolbox for the interface. We will also look through some code to see how the Go masters are using them best. Let’s tell those ducks how to walk and how to talk.</p>

			<p>Go is picking up a lot of steam these days, but yet your company and/or client still isn't using it. How do you convince others that Go is the right tool for the job?<br /><br />In this talk we'll look how you can sell Go to your boss, clients, and fellow co-workers. I'll give you all the ammunition you need to make a convincing argument for this powerful language, and how to respond to the usual FUD arguments you get. I'll also let you in on some "sneaky" ways to get Go into your business.<br /><br />By the end of this talk you’ll be a full fledged Go advocate.</p>

			<p>Go language is still in its embryonic stage, and it has yet to find prevalent real-world use or upkeep. Nonetheless, it appears like a mounting tryout, and I thought if it could have a future in game development. I haven't been able to discover much game-specific applications in Go anywhere, and figured a presentation and discussion may be appropriate on a platform like GopherConIndia. The foremost intention to come out with this explicit topic for the conference was to answer the recurring questions - do you think there is a future of game programming with Go? What is better than a hands-on confirmation to answer the questions. I haven’t been a crackerjack game developer, but I do have a tad of longing for the actual programming for developing the games. And thus the idea of "scrabble" came in to the picture.<br /><br />Now you may ask why scrabble? Many board games have come and gone, scrabble is undoubtedly the game that has survived the test of time. This board game has been around for roughly 65 years. The game of scrabble is a household favorite that can be played by young or old alike. This game integrates all of the elements of edutainment.<br /><br />I love Go for server code in my working day job, so why not? It has modest, overhead GLbindings; neat facilities for bit-banging, and swift compile times.<br /><br />However the game is not a standalone game developed in Golang. We have used iOS for the front end. Back-end part, we are using Golang as API service.<br /><br />Some of the Key Features of the Game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a two-player game.</li>
<li>It is designed in such a way that it follows the rules prescribed by <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/discover/rules.cfm">http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/discover/rules.cfm</a>.</li>
<li>We have the option to calculate scores for each player.</li>
<li>We have the option to replace all the tiles that are on the board and put it back into the bag.</li>
<li>We have a bag of 187 characters.</li>
<li>Once the board is filled completely, we calculate the score and display the winner.</li>
<li>We also provide Skip, which will enable opponent to make a move.</li>
</ul>

			<p>In this talk I'll share my experience building a real-life Android product with Go and Java from the ground up, focusing on the trade-offs that long time Android developers have to make, but also the concrete benefits that developers can find during the practical implementation, beyond the theoretical features and lang specs that Go developers are already familiar with.</p>

			<p>There are various  scenarios where programmers find  it difficult to make a choice based on performance of code. Scenarios like, whether to choose Data structure A or B ?? Or logic A performs better than logic B ?? Is it better to Unmarshal the post body request into a map or into a struct ?? Or Need to tune the code for performance benefits ? Dont worry, with Go Benchmark and profiling it's really easy. Explore the ease of use of Go Benchmarks and profiling in everyday Golang coding to make your code perform better.</p>

			<p>Microservices have rapidly evolved over the years as a popular way of developing applications. Let's explore the common characteristics and design patterns used while designing, developing, maintaining and governing distributed systems. We will also talk about common Unix philosophies and how we kept those in mind while we designed Gilmour: a framework to write and maintain effective microservices that exchange data over non-HTTP transports. Finally, we will go through some code samples demonstrating how Gilmour is used to address the above discussed design patterns.</p>

				Gabriel has been programming since the early 90s, starting out with Pascal and C which are still two of his favorite languages to day. Soon thereafter, he started exploring the web development world with various languages and eventually became specialized in JavaScript. When Go was released, it revived his passion for programming and he was instantly hooked. Go was the perfect combination of his favorite programming languages from the past. During his career, Gabriel worked on a contractual basis for various companies in Romania, Denmark, United Kingdom and the USA.

			<p>As the world is getting increasingly global, applications need to handle an increasingly large number of human languages. Internationalization support in Go has been designed to optimize the typical Go server use case, meaning static binaries, streaming text handling, and multiple users. I will show some of the key features of Go's internationalization support and how to use it in your applications.</p>

			<p>As computer hardware becomes more powerful with multiple processors and the number of users who need to be served within fractions of a second multiply, individuals and companies wrongly assume that investing in costlier hardware will automatically provide greater throughput. Provisioning costly machines is not useful until your programming language and programs can utilize it. In this talk Sathish VJ will demonstrate with small code examples how Go can be used to fully exploit your provisioned hardware and thus deliver greater throughput to your end users.</p>

			<p>I will start things off with a brief introduction of SoStronk and what it does (everyone confuses us for a game building company). Then jump right in into the meaty Go bits.<br /><br />The next part of the talk will be about how we make the various components tick in Go (the architecture). A distributed system (in this case a product) always makes a fun read. Splitting the architecture between AppEngine (the backend) and the real hardware (the wild wild west) was also a interesting journey and I will lay it out for the audience in the most interesting way possible.<br /><br />I am going to dedicate sometime on how we have sometimes made mistakes along the way (betting on things too BETA for our own good) and how we have learnt from heros in the Go community (like the awesome inconshreveable) and made the overall product better by just paying good attention to the detail.<br /><br />Google has been a big factor in making this startup happen and I believe in giving credit where it's due. So I would conclude the talk by highlighting the power what is possible through AppEngine-Go and how we leveraged almost every part of it in our journey.</p>
