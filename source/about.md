Ruby Conf India
===============

Launched in 2010, RubyConf India is India's premier Ruby and Rails conference and one of the largest RubyConfs in the world.

Sold out every year since its inception, the sixth iteration of the conference is scheduled on 4th and 5th April 2015 at the Cidade-de-Goa resort, Goa.
