			<p>Go language is still in its embryonic stage, and it has yet to find prevalent real-world use or upkeep. Nonetheless, it appears like a mounting tryout, and I thought if it could have a future in game development. I haven't been able to discover much game-specific applications in Go anywhere, and figured a presentation and discussion may be appropriate on a platform like GopherConIndia. The foremost intention to come out with this explicit topic for the conference was to answer the recurring questions - do you think there is a future of game programming with Go? What is better than a hands-on confirmation to answer the questions. I havenâ€™t been a crackerjack game developer, but I do have a tad of longing for the actual programming for developing the games. And thus the idea of "scrabble" came in to the picture.<br /><br />Now you may ask why scrabble? Many board games have come and gone, scrabble is undoubtedly the game that has survived the test of time. This board game has been around for roughly 65 years. The game of scrabble is a household favorite that can be played by young or old alike. This game integrates all of the elements of edutainment.<br /><br />I love Go for server code in my working day job, so why not? It has modest, overhead GLbindings; neat facilities for bit-banging, and swift compile times.<br /><br />However the game is not a standalone game developed in Golang. We have used iOS for the front end. Back-end part, we are using Golang as API service.<br /><br />Some of the Key Features of the Game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a two-player game.</li>
<li>It is designed in such a way that it follows the rules prescribed by <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/discover/rules.cfm">http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/discover/rules.cfm</a>.</li>
<li>We have the option to calculate scores for each player.</li>
<li>We have the option to replace all the tiles that are on the board and put it back into the bag.</li>
<li>We have a bag of 187 characters.</li>
<li>Once the board is filled completely, we calculate the score and display the winner.</li>
<li>We also provide Skip, which will enable opponent to make a move.</li>
</ul>
