			<p>Are you using interfaces effectively? Interfaces are one of the most powerful language features that Go provides, yet Go programmers often under-utilize existing interfaces in their code. Even many advanced Gophers rarely write their own interfaces, or write interfaces that are less powerful than they could be.<br /><br />This talk provides a behind-the-scenes look at the two most ubiquitous interfaces of them all: the humble "io.Reader" and "error". These interfaces are simple in nature, yet hold the key to writing powerful code. In this talk, we will learn how to design our own interfaces in Go that are simple yet powerful â€“ just like "io.Reader" and "error". We will learn how to correctly identify the places where writing interfaces will improve our code, and the specific steps to ensuring that our interfaces - and therefore our programs - are as powerful as they can be.</p>
