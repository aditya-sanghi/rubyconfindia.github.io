			<p>New Go developers follow a typical pattern: Find Go. Start learning Go. Pull in a bunch of external dependencies into their projects. While this pattern allows good software to be created, it often neglects all the great software the Go standard library contains. In this talk, we'll take a look at the standard library from the eyes of a beginner. We'll evaluate built in solutions versus external dependencies. Next, we'll review when it's appropriate to use external dependencies, Finally we'll leave with the knowledge of how to use the tools we were given rather along with external tools to help us create great software.</p>
