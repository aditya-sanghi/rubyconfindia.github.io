			<p>I will start things off with a brief introduction of SoStronk and what it does (everyone confuses us for a game building company). Then jump right in into the meaty Go bits.<br /><br />The next part of the talk will be about how we make the various components tick in Go (the architecture). A distributed system (in this case a product) always makes a fun read. Splitting the architecture between AppEngine (the backend) and the real hardware (the wild wild west) was also a interesting journey and I will lay it out for the audience in the most interesting way possible.<br /><br />I am going to dedicate sometime on how we have sometimes made mistakes along the way (betting on things too BETA for our own good) and how we have learnt from heros in the Go community (like the awesome inconshreveable) and made the overall product better by just paying good attention to the detail.<br /><br />Google has been a big factor in making this startup happen and I believe in giving credit where it's due. So I would conclude the talk by highlighting the power what is possible through AppEngine-Go and how we leveraged almost every part of it in our journey.</p>
